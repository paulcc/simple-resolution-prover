========================

Building
--------

To compile

    ghc Main.lhs

... will automatically make dependencies etc



OR you can use "ghci" on parts of this, eg

    ghci Main.lhs


Code has been tested with GHC 7.4.1, but doesn't use anything unusual so should work with most versions


Running
-------

Run the executable, or run "main" in ghci

By default, it runs the prover on the theorem in file "eg_two"



Reading the code
----------------

Help yourselves! Feel free to raise questions in issues etc.
